# 2. Classic Patterns

## Classic Patterns
- [Design Patterns (by Grady Booch)](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)
- a lot of UML, diagrams, it's not close to a web developer; 이것도 공감해주시다니, 예전 사내 스터디 열정이 떠오른다!
- We can emulate some those ideas, but it's not 100% OOP language, which means 'might not be suitable for JS'
- the same problem can be solved in very different ways.



## Singleton & Factory Patterns
### Singleton

- problem : Ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- 💡실무 공감 : UTM 관리 객체 정의할 때 SPA, MPA에서 singletone을 어떻게 유지할지, 리로드되면 다시 생성되지 않게 막는 방법 고민하던게 떠오른다.
- Use Cases
   - Managing a global configuration object
   - DB connection pooling
   - Logging service
   - State management
- In JS, we can create an object, a literal object. don't need to always create a class.
- 어떤 자료를 읽으면 다 class 를 선언하니깐 you start thinking how I'm going to create the class then...; 😂 어떻게 내가 생각한 루트 그대로 언급하실까.. 

### Factory
- problem : Object creation can become complex and may involve multiple steps, conditional logic, or dependencies
- 실생활 예시 : google drive - 새 문서 생성 시, 사전 질의 응답 step 에 따라 템플릿 생성
- By the way, design patterns are not magic. what we are doing is decoupling the problem or the code in seperate processes or componenets of the app
- Use Cases
   - UI element creation : different kind of buttons based on A
   - Different types of notifications
   - Data Parsers
- 💡 실무 아이디어 : Design System 확장을 Factory 패턴으로 만들어보면 어떨까?
   - modal.title('제목').description('안내 메시지'); 이건 빌더 패턴 같긴하다



## Decorator Pattern
- problem : Add additional functionality to objects dynamically without modifying their structure.
- Use Cases
   - Adding logging, validation, or caching to method calls.
   - Extending user interface components with additional features
   - Warpping API responses to format or process data before passing it on.
- 💡 실무 고민 : Logging을 깔끔하게 관리하는 방법, 기존 컴포넌트를 손대지 않고도 확장 정의가 과연 가능할까?



## Adapter, Mixin & Value Object Patterns
### Adapter
- problem : Allow incompatible interfaces to work together. 
- Use Cases
   - Converting data formats
   - Integrating third-party libraries with different interfaces into your application.
   - Adapting legacy code to work with new systems or APIs
- 💡 실무 고민 : dto 에 사용할 수 있을까?


### Mixins
- problem : Share functionality between classes without using inheritance.

### Value Object
- problem : Represent a value that is immutable and distinct from other objects based on its properties rather than its identity.
- Code example : Object.freeze, define equals method.
- Use Cases
   - Representing complex data types like money, coordinates, or dates



## Observer & Template Method Patterns
### Observer
- problem : Allow an object to notify other objects about changes in its state requiring them to be tightly coupled
- Use Cases
   - Event Handlers
   - Real-time notifications
   - UI updates
- pub/sub is just another name for observer.


### Template method
- problem : define the skeleton of an algorithm that will change on different implementations
- Use Cases
   - Data Processing
   - Form Validation
- 예제를 보니깐 abstract class, implement 따로 정의한 느낌



## Memento & Command Patterns
### Memento Pattern
- problem : Capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation
- Use Cases
   - Undo/Redo functionality
   - Saving a game or app session
   - Time-travel debugging


### Command Pattern
- problem : How to avoid hard-wiring a request from its invoker
- Use Cases
   - Manage the actions of your app ( such as Add, Delete, print, save, load)
